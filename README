A set of functions to handle alphanumeric displays compatible with
HD44780 driver.

This set is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, see
the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The source code is tested by me on ATMEL microcontroller ATMega8, 2x16 character
LCD display only in 4bit mode, but 8bit mode is simpler and there should not be
major bugs. List of available function is placed in 'API' file.
